# Visual-Novel-Manager-v2

A complete rework of my old visual novel manager, found here:
[https://github.com/micah686/Visual-Novel-Manager](https://github.com/micah686/Visual-Novel-Manager)

This should be fairly stable at this point in time. However, it is still under heavy devlopment, and the database design might change.
As such, there may be a loss of data in between different builds. I will continue to make drastic changes to the database design until version 1.0.0.0

If there are features you want added, PLEASE add an issue, as I can't add a feature if I don't know if people want it.

if you have feature suggestions, please put create an Issue or comment on this google doc:
