# Visual-Novel-Manager-v2

A complete rework of my old visual novel manager, found here:
[https://github.com/micah686/Visual-Novel-Manager](https://github.com/micah686/Visual-Novel-Manager)

This will be NON-FUNCTIONAL for a while, as I am slowly adding fucntionality to it. 
I'll remove this notice when I actually have some features implemented.

if you have feature suggestions, please put create an Issue or comment on this google doc:
