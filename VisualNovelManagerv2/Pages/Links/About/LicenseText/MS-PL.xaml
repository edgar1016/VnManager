                    1. Definitions
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    The terms "reproduce," "reproduction," "derivative works," and "distribution" have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright law.
                    A "contribution" is the original software, or any additions or changes to the software.
                    A "contributor" is any person that distributes its contribution under this license.
                    "Licensed patents" are a contributor's patent claims that read directly on its contribution.
                </Paragraph>
