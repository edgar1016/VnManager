These are just personal reminders for me to keep track of what I need to fix/add

- Dispose of views and viewmodels/free up memory
- Add Categories to dropdown
- Add right click to vnList
- Load long lists of names into tables, to deal with lists of 1000+ entries.
- Create seperate sections for votelist, vnlist, and wishlist
- Possibly create a custom style for screenshots to set the border from blue to red when NSFW
