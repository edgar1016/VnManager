These are just personal reminders for me to keep track of what I need to fix/add

- [ ] Dispose of views and viewmodels/free up memory
- [ ] Load long lists of names into tables, to deal with lists of 1000+ entries.
- [ ] Need to work on VnListViewModel for checking edge cases
- [ ] Check VnUserList where big images make the list look weird
- [X] add a bool to prevent users from adding a gaame while another is processing.
- [X]  reload screenshot viewmodel after changing nsfw status
- [ ] Set up some sort of wait timer/pause bool to prevent trying to load another Vn once one is selected(for use when someone holds down, aand it tries to load a large amount)
- [X] Prevent user from playing a game while playing another one
- [ ] Replace FlowDocument with a BBCodeBlock, and have a converter to convert the vndb local URLs to standard BBCode URLs
- [ ] Fix the Tags collection messing up swhen switching between games


## Entity Framework Notes
I need to install these 2 packages from the nuget package manager(console doesn't work for second one)
```
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
```


### Suggestions from Google Docs
- [ ] Run in taskbar while game is running
- [ ] Automatic updater
- [ ] Vndb Website within program
- [ ] Visual novel scanner to search for visual novels
- [ ] Userlist items with advanced sorting
- [ ] Section tags off by All/Content/ Sexual Content/ Technical content
- [ ] Multiple user profiles?!(probably hard to implement)
- [ ] search for walkthrough/ savegames
- [ ] Password required to do activities(change NSFW settings, set votes/status/â€¦, view any data,....)
- [ ] Add a producers section, like list all Vns from KEY, Nitro+,...
- [ ] Advanced Category filters(sort by relase date,...)
- [ ] Be able to sort visual novels, and name categories, also being able to create sub categories would be nice. Example: sort by translated, or untranslated. Then further sort by producer/genre
